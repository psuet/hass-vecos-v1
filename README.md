# Vecos V1 Hub for Home Assistant

This custom component adds support for the Vecos V1 Hub controller to Home Assistant. It provides lock entities for each door, a USB‑power switch, binary sensors for connection status, and convenient services to open or close multiple locks at once.

NOTE: Since we don't have access to the original Vecos V1 Hub documentation, this integration requires the use of our custom Vecos V1 Hub firmware, which exposes a simple Serial interface for controlling the locks. We then use a Serial to TCP bridge to communicate with Home Assistant.

Please refer to the firmware repository: https://github.com/netz-ac/V1-Hub-Firmware


## Features
* Up to 16 locks (configurable via UI)
* Real‑time lock state synchronization (optimistic updates)
* USB power control as a switch entity
* Binary sensors for each lock’s connection status
* Services: vecos_v1_hub.open_locks & vecos_v1_hub.close_locks
* Restores last known state after Home Assistant restarts

---------|-------------|--------
host	 | IP address or hostname of the hub |–
port	 | TCP port  | 5000
